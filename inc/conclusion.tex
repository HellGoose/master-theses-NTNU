This chapter will contain the conclusion to the master. We will discuss limitations, results and how it all relates to the research questions.

    \section{Limitations}
    This section will contain a disclaimer for limitations affecting our results and discussion around these.
    
    \section{Discussion}
    This section will contain discussion around the results of this master. Might be merged with the Research Questions subsection.
    
    In real life you can observe the subjects facial micro expressions and relate that to what the subject is saying. I MR or VR you can only rely on the vocal tone, head orientation and hand gestures, and even though this might give you enough information to give correct feedback, facilitating in MR can still be more difficult. To close this gap between real life and MR and VR, more realistic avatars and better hardware will be needed. There are technologies in development that will let us accurately replicate the users facial expressions in MR and VR, but at the time of writing no such technology can easily be implemented into this application.
    
    \section{Research Questions}
    This section will contain an evaluation of the research questions and how they have or have not been answered.
